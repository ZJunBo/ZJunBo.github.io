I am currently a second-year doctoral candidate at the Multi-domain Intelligent Perception and Cognition Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University. I am supervised by Professor Jiang Wen, Professor Deng Xinyang, and Professor Zhou Qianli. My research interests include **LLM Safety**, **Mechanism Interpretability**, and **Computer Vsion**.

[**Understanding and Mitigating Over-refusal for Large Language Models via Safety Representation**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19009)
**Junbo Zhang**, Ran Chen, Qianli Zhou, Xinyang Deng, Wen Jiang

we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating overrefusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.
